    <h3>This map shows the number of McDonald's per 100,000 people in each state. Overall, California had the most McDonalds (it has very large population and is also large area-wise). However, I was interested in loooking at the number of McDonalds compared to population data so that I could study this phenomenon more accurately.  The states with the hghest density of McDonalds per person were in the South and Midwest. The northeats and the west coast seemed to have the least McDonalds comapred to state population. I chose this topic because I am interested in publci health, and I have learned a lot about the interaction between fast food chains and public health outcomes. Fast food is a widely studied public health issue, and is often associated with worse public health outcomes (diabetes, obesity, etc). However, there are many other factors that contribute to these health outcomes as well.  </h3>
